ADA Fall 2020 Wedge Project

##
All files are added to the repo. 
The Submission file includes which files are for which part of the assginment, the GBQ queries results, and my reflection.

## Feedback

Looks great, consider this **complete**. Appreciate the thoughtful reflections. A couple of small things: 

* Try to keep your lines to under 80 characters in width. You have a couple of comments that exceed that. Keeping the width low
helps with readability across platforms.
* Task 2 has a massive print to the screen of `owners`. Don't worry about resubmitting, but remember to avoid that in future 
submissions.
